### Problem

Demand for air conditioners is growing steadily with increases in summer heat due to climate change. Air conditioning is often necessary to reduce heat stress to vulnerable citizens, however, it also has the unfortunate side effects of increasing electricity bills, increasing electricity demand, and adding heat to shared outdoor spaces. To help conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, consumers can choose to buy more efficient air conditioners or forego air conditioners entirely. Therefore, we need to inform consumers about the costs of air conditioning to their wallets, and to the environment, so that we may have a cooler future.

### Solution

Our solution is to build an application that makes it easy for consumers to predict the operating costs of air conditioning units. Our application is an intelligent air conditioner cost calculator that only requires a postal code to provide the user with a personalized cost estimate. This provides the user with easy access to information that could influence them to buy a more efficient air conditioner, or to open their windows instead.

### Application features

Our calculator uses the location of the user to calculate a personalized cost estimate, based on climate parameters specific to that user’s home. The calculator selects an appropriate weather station close to the user to retrieve a statistical measure of how often the air conditioner would be needed to obtain a comfortable temperature. The user has the option to choose their own specific air conditioning unit from a list of all air conditioners sold in Canada to obtain more accurate results. The specific efficiency and capacity statistics are retrieved from the Open Government database on energy consumption of home appliances. In addition, our calculator will predict future costs of running the air conditioner, using climate forecast models from Environment and Climate Change Canada’s databases. This will raise environmental awareness as future years operation costs will increase with climate change.

### Future directions

We believe that specialized and easy to access cost estimates will greatly encourage consumers to make environmentally friendly and wallet friendly choices when purchasing an air conditioner. Furthermore, cost projections based on climate change models, will help a new audience visualize the consequences of climate change in a unique way. In addition, we hope to increase the functionality of the app in the future. We plan to add connectivity to Wi-Fi-enabled smart air conditioners so that usage statistics can be monitored. The calculator accuracy could then be improved with machine learning algorithms trained on the new usage database. This data could also be useful to help predict peak demand in summer months, helping electricity providers plan accordingly.
